Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see,
I’m just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
Because I’m easy come, easy go, little high, little low,
Any way the wind blows doesn’t really matter to me, to me.

Mama, just killed a man, put a gun against his head,
pulled my trigger, now he’s dead.
Mama, life had just begun,
But now I’ve gone and thrown it all away.
